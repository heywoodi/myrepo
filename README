
set initial conditions of the pendulum in the config file
'method' is set to 1, 2, or 3, and corresponds to euler, euler-cromer, and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods respectively.
time step is the time step for the methods to run (dt), and 'Number Of Cycles" corresponds to the amount of times to run the method

run the simulation with method.py to produce a datafile.npy, and graph energies of the system with egraphs.py, and momentums with pgraphs.py



simulation time = time step x number of cycles.
